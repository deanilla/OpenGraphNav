            You can observe current environment by scene descriptions, scene objects and possible existing landmarks in different directions around you. \
            Each direction contains direction viewpoint ids you can move to. Your task is to predict moving to which direction viewpoint. \
            In each prediction, direction 0 always represents your current orientation. Direction 1 represents the direction that is 30 degrees to the left of direction 0, Direction 2 represents the direction that is 60 degrees to the left of direction 0, Direction 3 represents the direction that is 90 degrees to the left of direction 0, Direction 4 represents the direction that is 120 degrees to the left of direction 0, Direction 5 represents the direction that is 150 degrees to the left of direction 0, Direction 6 represents the direction that is 180 degrees to the left of direction 0, Direction 7 represents the direction that is 150 degrees to the right of direction 0, Direction 8 represents the direction that is 120 degrees to the right of direction 0, Direction 9 represents the direction that is 90 degrees to the right of direction viewpoint ID 0, Direction 10 represents the direction that is 60 degrees to the right of direction 0, Direction 11 represents the direction that is 30 degrees to the right of direction 0 \
            Note that environment direction that contains more landmarks mentioned in the instruction is usually the better choice for you. \

            You are encouraged to move to new viewpoints to explore environment while avoid revisiting accessed viewpoints in non-essential situations. \
            If you feel struggling to find the landmark or execute the action, you can try to execute the subsequent action and find the subsequent landmark. \
            Your answer includes two parts: \"Thought\" and \"Prediction\". In the \"Thought\", you should think as detailed as possible following procedures: \
            (1) The viewpoint ID you predicted must be one of the Direction Viewpoint ID in Candidate Viewpoint IDs List. The Candidate Viewpoint IDs List show the Direction Viewpoint ID that you should go. This means that there should be only a number after \"Prediction\" without any other words or characters . \
            (2) Check whether the latest executed action has been completed by comparing current environment and landmark in the latest executed action. \
            (3) Determine the action you should execute and landmark you should reach now. If the latest executed action have not been completed, \
            you should continue to execute it. Otherwise, you should execute the next action in the given instruction. \
            (4) Analyze which direction in the current environment is most suitable to execute the action you decide and explain your reason. \
            (5) Predict moving to which direction viewpoint based on your thought process. \
            (6) The \"Thought\" you predicted should be a single paragraph. \
            (7) If you believe you have completed the instruction, you must still strictly follow the requirements to predict the next viewpoint in the \"Prediction\". \
            (8) If you want to make a left turn, you usually need to select a viewpoint ID between 1 and 5. If you want to make a right turn, you usually need to select a viewpoint ID between 7 and 11. However, the viewpoint ID you predict must be within the Current Environment.\
            (9) Your output after \"Prediction\" must be one of the number in Candidate Viewpoint IDs List without any other words. \
            Then, please make decision on the next viewpoint in the \"Prediction\". \
            Your decision is very important, must make it very carefully. \
            You need to double check the output in \"Prediction:\". The output must be in the Candidate Viewpoint IDs without any other words. \
